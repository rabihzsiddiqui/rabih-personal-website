    "Colleges and universities host many students every year and as the number of students grow business around these places also grow, some even forming college towns where businesses’ livelihoods depend on students like at UC Davis. We were curious as to specifically restaurants in the vicinity of a college or university and as students of UCSD, it follows that we were curious about restaurants around that specific area. As a restaurant’s success or profits are hard to measure and obtain, we settled on trying to see if restaurants’ ratings are affected by their vicinity to UCSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "One article published by QSR Magazine seems to indicate so, citing data from “College & University Keynote Report” from Datassential saying that 58% of students eat off campus and 49% of students consider themselves foodies and are more conscious about what they eat.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) This means that more than half of the student body is regularly eating at restaurants around their campus and reviewing and recommending those restaurants. Another study that more closely looks at customer satisfaction with food service, points out several important factors that can contribute to a restaurant’s rating such as their food quality, service quality, decor quality, and most importantly price.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) The conclusions they found is that good service and then good food were the best indicators of a high customer satisfaction. These point out significant attributes that aren’t considered in our research question, and possibly could be much greater of a factor of a restaurant’s rating than distance.\n",

    "We believe that restaurants further from the university/college campuses will have similar ratings as those closer to university/college campuses. While an influx of students in the area can have an impact on nearby restaurants, we believe that this impact will be minimal and negligible. This is because students don’t make up a majority of a restaurants’ clientele, especially in more metropolitan areas. There are many other customers that either live in the area or are traveling that can give ratings to restaurants."

Our initial selection was based on the top cities (with most reviews) in our dataset. However, upon further analysis, we identified that 51% of the cities in the top 29 in our dataset didn't have universities that fit our research criteria. We then refined our list to only include cities with universities in the city limits."

    "We need inclusive data representation, by ensuring the dataset adequately represents different types of restaurants and doesn’t exclude any significant group. We must ensure that the data sources that we use comply with ethical standards and privacy laws. The data should be publicly available and not include any personal information about individuals who submitted the ratings. We must review the data and results to monitor for biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data on Yelp and Google Maps is self-uploaded, so some restaurants may not appear. Since the data is self-uploaded, we believe the restaurants would be open to having other people see it. The restaurants are self-uploaded. After a restaurant is uploaded, they cannot be taken down unless the restaurant has closed down. Since closed restaurants do not show up, the data could be biased. For instance, restaurants that have closed down could potentially have lower ratings, but these lower ratings are no longer part of the data. Another bias could be with online reviews in general. Restaurants could encourage positive reviews by offering a discount or a free dessert to customers. Another concern is that people who have a negative experience might feel frustrated and post negative reviews while a person who has a great experience has no problems, so they also don’t feel the need to make a review. Negative reviews may be overrepresented. \n",
    "\n",
    "We must develop a methodology that addresses these issues, such as figuring out how we are going to include each level of budget, restaurant type, etc. We have to be sure to exclude personal identifiers (such as names) for those who submitted reviews. We also have to make sure to remove the reviewer’s names. We will include restaurants in the main price categories and all cuisines that are ordered to avoid bias."

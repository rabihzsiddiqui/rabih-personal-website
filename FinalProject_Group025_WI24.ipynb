    "# Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "As students, we often find ourselves deciding where to dine out. When looking for new restaurants, one of the first things we do is peruse yelp ratings/reviews to see nearby restaurants and others' dining experiences at those restaurants. Knowing this, we were curious as to whether businesses in proximity to universities have better/worse ratings and whether whether students patrons rated restaurants lower/higher relative to other customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To focus our study on venues frequented by students, we first filtered yelp's dataset to include businesses under the \"Restaurant\" and \"Coffee & Tea\". Then, we selected several universities in the US and applied haversine's formula to calculate the distance between each university and the restaurants within the same city. For our project, we defined \"close to a university\" as under 5 kilometers, with anything above being defined as \"not close to a university.\" This distance was chosen due to its accessibility via public transportation and walking, aligning with typical student mobility. Our analysis revealed a trend: restaurants proximate to universities tend to have marginally higher ratings than those farther away. While the discrepancy is subtle, it's discernible and statistically significant, suggesting a non-random association.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transitioning to the next section, we wanted to answer the question: \"Does distance from university affect a restaurants's rating?\" Perhaps restaurants that are near universities have better food beacuse the lease is more expensive and they need more customers to sustain their business. For this question, we answer it using linear regression. We found that while distance from university affects rating, the effect is basically negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we wanted to see whether students tend to give better/worse ratings than other customers, so we used keywords to classify whether a review was written by a student or not. For this question, we also answer it using permutation tests to see whether any differences are caused by chance. Our conclusion was that students give lower ratings and the differences between students and non-students are not caused by chance."

    "Colleges and universities host many students every year and as the number of students grow business around these places also grow, some even forming college towns where businesses’ livelihoods depend on students like at UC Davis. As students of UCSD, we were curious as to specifically restaurants in the vicinity of a college or university. As a restaurant’s success or profits are hard to measure and obtain, we settled on trying to see if restaurants’ ratings are affected by their vicinity to the university in their city.\n",
    "\n",
    "One article published by QSR Magazine seems to indicate so, citing data from “College & University Keynote Report” from Datassential saying that 58% of students eat off campus and 49% of students consider themselves foodies and are more conscious about what they eat.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) This means that more than half of the student body is regularly eating at restaurants around their campus and reviewing and recommending those restaurants. Another study that more closely looks at customer satisfaction with food service, points out several important factors that can contribute to a restaurant’s rating such as their food quality, service quality, decor quality, and most importantly price.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) The conclusions they found is that good service and then good food were the best indicators of a high customer satisfaction. These point out significant attributes that aren’t considered in our research question, and possibly could be much greater of a factor of a restaurant’s rating than distance.\n",

    "We believe that restaurants further from the university/college campuses will have similar ratings as those closer to university/college campuses. While an influx of students in the area can have an impact on nearby restaurants, we believe that this impact will be minimal and negligible. This is because students don’t make up a majority of a restaurants’ clientele, especially in more metropolitan areas. There are many other customers that either live in the area or are traveling that can give ratings to restaurants."

    "We need inclusive data representation, by ensuring the dataset adequately represents different types of restaurants and doesn’t exclude any significant group. We must ensure that the data sources that we use comply with ethical standards and privacy laws. The data should be publicly available and not include any personal information about individuals who submitted the ratings. We must review the data and results to monitor for biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data on Yelp and Google Maps is self-uploaded, so some restaurants may not appear. Since the data is self-uploaded, we believe the restaurants would be open to having other people see it. The restaurants are self-uploaded. After a restaurant is uploaded, they cannot be taken down unless the restaurant has closed down. Since closed restaurants do not show up, the data could be biased. For instance, restaurants that have closed down could potentially have lower ratings, but these lower ratings are no longer part of the data. Another bias could be with online reviews in general. Restaurants could encourage positive reviews by offering a discount or a free dessert to customers. Another concern is that people who have a negative experience might feel frustrated and post negative reviews while a person who has a great experience has no problems, so they also don’t feel the need to make a review. Negative reviews may be overrepresented. \n",

    "# Discussion and Conclusion\n",
    "Our comprehensive data analysis so far has provided us with insightful revelations about the relationship between a restaurant’s distance to universities/colleges campuses in different cities and its Yelp ratings, as well as the influence of student reviewers on these ratings. After wrangling the raw dataset via various methods, we finalized it into a comprehensive dataframe that contains the important columns of information that we wanted like ‘is the restaurant close to campus or not’, ‘is the reviewers a student or not’ and ‘yelp ratings of these restaurants’ etc. And then our team conducted a series of data analysis on this dataframe using relevant statistical techniques and methods including performing permutation test,t-test and linear regression. Based on what we had so far, we can conclude that the distance of restaurants from campuses bears very minimal correlation with their Yelp ratings, suggesting that distance of restaurants from campuses is not necessarily important in how customers perceive or rate these restaurants. Besides, the analysis indicates that ratings submitted by students would lower the average ratings of these restaurants and that’s a general trend across the 10 universities that we had for our analysis, but the influence is too small to be actually taken into consideration in practical terms. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we do believe that there are several limitations in regards to the scope and outcomes of our analysis. One of the primary constraints was the selection of only 10 cities and universities for our analysis. This choice was dictated by time constraints and the fact that only 49% of the top 29 cities in our dataset met our research criteria. Consequently, this limitation raises questions about the generalizability of our findings to other cities and university contexts worldwide. Additionally, the method we used to distinguish between student and non-student reviews faced challenges, with a notable presence of false positives and negatives. This issue potentially affected the accuracy of our interpretations. Expanding the dataset to include a more diverse range of cities and improving the accuracy of identifying student reviews are helpful for better future research. These enhancements would not only address the limitations of our current research but also provide a more comprehensive understanding of how location and customer demographics influence restaurant ratings on platforms like Yelp.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe our work contributes to a broader understanding of what influences students’ patronage at restaurants. While other previous studies have focused on factors like food quality, service,decor and price, our research added a new dimension by exploring the spatial aspect of dining preferences. Future research can be done based on our work to investigate more about the factors that might influence consumer behaviors and to provide inspiration for restaurant owners on how to attract more customers.\n",
